# Premier League Match Prediction âš½

This folder contains experiments and models related to predicting the outcomes of Premier League matches.  
The dataset includes historical match data such as goals scored, goals conceded, and match outcomes.  

## ðŸ”¹ Whatâ€™s inside?
- Data preprocessing scripts  
- Feature engineering (Home/Away goals, results, etc.)  
- Machine learning models for match outcome prediction  
- Example predictions (e.g., Newcastle vs Liverpool)  

## ðŸš€ Goal
The aim is to explore how past performance data (goals, wins, draws, losses) can be used to predict the result of upcoming matches.  

Stay tuned as more experiments and improvements are added! âš¡
